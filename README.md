# S2Net
"Benchmarking Laryngeal Neoplasm Segmentation: A Multicenter Dataset and an Effective Method"
1) Our work primarily introduces the first multicenter Laryngeal Neoplasm Segmentation (LNS) dataset, which includes laryngeal images from four hospitals, with pixel-wise annotations to create this dataset.
2) We explore and analyze the challenges and difficulties of the LNS task. Based on this analysis, we propose an effective LNS network S2Net. We hope our insights will contribute to the future development of LNS methods.

Currently, our work is under submission, and once accepted, we will release the dataset, benchmarking results, and source code for S2Net.
